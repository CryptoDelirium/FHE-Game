# Docs Overview

Learn how to secure smart contracts with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) through a game of Rock-Paper Scissors. This game demonstrates how players can submit an encrypted input, in multi-player or single-player mode, and request offchain decryption from the frontend - the player choices are never revealed onchain. 

## Quicklinks
- New devs can follow the [tutorial] for a full walkthrough and step-by-step explanation of the project.

- Experienced devs can head over straight to the [API] to develop their own frontend.

- To learn more about Fully Homomorphic Encryption, check out the FHE overview on the next page.

- Visit our [blog] for in depth knowledge on FHE and Blockchain!
